### Steps followed 

Steps Followed in Solving the Business Problem and Creating the Report
1. Problem Understanding and Objective Definition
Clearly defined the business problem by analyzing the dataset context and identifying the key areas of concern.

Established the primary objectives of the analysis, ensuring alignment with business goals such as improving sales, understanding customer behavior, or tracking performance metrics.

2. Data Collection and Exploration
Gathered the required dataset from the given source.

Performed an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, size, and types of variables in the dataset.

Identified missing values, data inconsistencies, and potential outliers for further treatment.

3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handled missing data by applying suitable imputation techniques or removal strategies.

Standardized and formatted data (e.g., date formatting, removing duplicates, normalizing values).

Ensured data consistency across all variables to prepare it for accurate analysis.
